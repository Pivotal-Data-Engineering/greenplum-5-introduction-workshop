This type of storage also works well for cases where only certain columns will be modified.\n","4338f189a31046ddd55aad24e5294ec1":"Greenplum provides support for two table storage models with various options:\n- Heap – Unless otherwise specified, Greenplum tables are created using the heap storage model. Heap tables allow you to add new rows, update existing rows, and remove rows from the table. These types of transactions are seen in OLTP databases where data is often modified after it has been loaded. \n- Append-optimized – An append-optimized table is optimized for data warehouses. If you follow the strictest definition of the data warehouse, data is not normally modified once it has been loaded into its permanent table. Append-optimized tables do afford some flexibility in that they permit updates and deletes. \n- Append-optimized tables work well for large batch uploads, as opposed to single row inserts. Large fact tables, where data does not normally require changes, are ideal candidates for append-optimized storage. \n- Append-optimized storage does not work with transactions that use serializable isolation levels, as would be seen with single-row inserts. Append-only storage uses a visibility map to mark the rows which should be visible versus those that should not be (due to deletion).\nBoth storage models support row-oriented tables, whereas column-oriented tables are only supported with append-optimized storage.\nAppend-optimized storage also supports in-database compression at the table and column levels.\n","55122edf21fae4bb5b6211245271844c":"Unless otherwise specified, the default behavior when creating a table is to create a heap storage table with row orientation.\nTo create an append-optimized table, you must include the clause \nWITH (appendonly=true) in your table definition.\nTo specify column orientation, use the \nWITH (appendonly=true, orientation=column) clause in your table definition.\nYou cannot change the storage model or orientation of an existing table. You can instead create a new table with the desired storage model and orientation and migrate your data into that table (we did this in the demo, using “CREATE TABLE AS SELECT …”)\n\n","b48fdb4b72a688d6df1f0271cbcf8504":"When applying compression to the table, you include the compression type and level in the WITH clause of your table definition.\nIn the first example, the zlib compression algorithm is applied to the table using the clause  “WITH (appendonly=true, compresstype=zlib, compresslevel=5)”.\nThe default compression level is 1\n.\nThe second example shows how to define a QuickLZ compressed table by including the “compresstype=quicklz” option in the WITH clause.\n\nIn the third example, compression algorithms are applied, separately, to two columns. Column compression requires the ENCODING clause as part of the column definition. Here, the sales column will use zlib compression at compression level 3, while the salesdate column will use rle_type compression.\n\n","9d92ea512cc89cd6f3459246f759d0e4":"Append-optimized tables support compression at two levels:\n- Table-level compression is applied to the entire table with support for ZLIB and QuickLZ; RLE_TYPE can also be used at the table level if ORIENTATION=COLUMN.\n- If ORIENTATION=COLUMN, each column’s compression spec can be applied independently.\nThe order of precedence for compression specs, from lowest to highest, is table, column, partition, and subpartition. \n\nThe various algorithms offer different performance and compression, depending on the data.\n- ZLIB is the default algorithm that offers greater compression, but at lower speeds. At compression level 1, zlib offers the fastest compression with the lowest ratio, while at 9, it offers the most compact compression, but at the cost of slower speed.\n- QuickLZ uses less CPU and compresses data faster, but at a lower compression ratio than zlib, and it offers a single compression level.\n- RLE_TYPE offers run-length encoding (RLE) for column-level compression. With RLE, repeated data is stored as a single value along with a count of the number of times that value is found. As of GPDB 4.3.3, for data stored using RLE, Delta compression is also applied for columns that are defined as BIGINT, INTEGER, DATE, TIME, or TIMESTAMP.\n","ff20bc99641e1b577d8d56688f04eae1":"The server configuration parameter, gp_default_storage_options, lets you define the storage options to automatically apply when creating a table with the CREATE TABLE command.\nThe options are a comma separated list, consisting of the storage options, APPENDONLY, BLOCKSIZE, CHECKSUM, COMPRESSTYPE, COMPRESSLEVEL, and ORIENTATION.\nThe default behavior can be set at various levels of the database: \nRole level using the ALTER ROLE SET … command\nDatabase level with the ALTER DATABASE SET … command.\nGlobal level using the gpconfig command.\nSpecifying options using the CREATE TABLE takes precedence over all other forms. The next order of precedence is the role level, followed by the database level, and then the system level.\n\nIn the bottom example, the DBA alters the “student” role to set up storage options specific to that account.\n","a8d81a312d0808fd64e01ef1e3999d06":"Greenplum Database provides support for a variety of table types to facilitate data processing and data loading or unloading. In addition to regular tables, the following table types are supported:\n\nTemporary tables – These are often used to store the results of queries that are required for a short period of time, during a single connection session, or for transforming data during an ELT process.\nExternal tables – External tables are used to facilitate data loading and unloading. They can be useful in a variety of applications, including to retrieve a stream of data from an external source, such as from Hadoop HDFS, a REST service, or an operating system command. They can also be used to move data between databases.\n\n\n","84f0c84a8d35fe185ba2f6559c47648b":"Temporary tables in Greenplum Database are session specific, are not shared across sessions, and are automatically dropped at the end of the session.\nIf you are not referencing tables by their schema-qualified names, a temporary table takes precedence over a permanent table with the same name.\nTemporary tables are automatically created in a special schema and cannot be assigned to a schema of your choosing.\nThese schemas are automatically created when you connect to a session, and are named to reflect the session’s connection ID (e.g. “pg_temp_32685”).\n\nTemporary tables and permanent tables are similar in the following ways:\nYou specify a distribution key for a temporary table.\nYou can create indexes against columns of a temporary table. These indexes are themselves temporary.\nTemporary tables can be analyzed, allowing the optimizer to generate an execution plan for the table.\n\nThey differ from permanent tables in that they are not added to the system catalog and therefore do not impact the size and performance of the system catalog.\n","27282b5a46b93543daedf54d278c9a56":"The most common use of a temporary table is to take a subset of data from a larger table, reorganize it, and use the results for reporting. This improves overall performance as you are now working on a subset of data instead of a very large dataset. When working with large tables, it is best to avoid performing a union on a large number of queries against large tables. Instead, if you can reduce the size of your table to just what is needed, you see improved performance.\n\nAnother use case for working with temporary tables is for data transformation. With the extract, load, and transform method (ELT), you load data directly into the database and then perform your transformations on the data, thereby taking advantage of the Greenplum MPP architecture to improve performance in an area that is often the slowest part of data migration.\n","5810fd2de3b0162cc64baa7627084137":"The syntax to create a temporary table is CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE or CREATE TEMP TABLE. \nIn this example, the temporary table, monthlytranssumarry is created with the distribution key on two columns: storeid and customerid. The rows of the temporary table will be preserved, or saved, at the end of the transaction, ensuring that the rows are not removed until the session has ended.\n\nThere are three ON COMMIT states that you can pass to the temporary table are:\nPRESERVE ROWS – The rows within the table are saved from removal at the end of a transaction block. This translates into no action being taken on the temporary table or its data.\nDELETE ROWS – The temporary table is truncated at the end of the transaction block, so all rows have been removed.\nDROP – The temporary table is dropped at the end of the transaction block. \n"}}};

# Greenplum Workshop Presentations

The presentations used throughout the workshop are contained here.

### Instructions for displaying the presentations when web access is not available:

- clone or download the Greenplum [github workshop repository](https://github.com/Pivotal-Data-Engineering/greenplum-open-source-workshop)
- `cd greenplum-open-source-workshop/presentations`
- Run a local web server and open up the `Greenplum-Workshop-Presentations.html` file
  * A nice solution I found is http-server from [https://github.com/http-party/http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server).
    It is a node app so to install just `npm install http-server -g`
  * To display the `index.html` file in the current directory and have it run on port 3000
    * `http-server . -p 3000 -o`
